## 🔹 Project Description

HybridCatPredictor is an open-source Python package designed to accelerate the discovery of **polyoxometalate (POM)-based hybrid photocatalysts**. It integrates:

- **Descriptor handling**: bandgap, CBM/VBM, POM LUMO, CO₂ adsorption energy, stability index.
- **Machine Learning models**: baseline Random Forest to predict photocatalytic activity.
- **Candidate ranking**: prioritizes materials likely to have strong visible-light response and CO₂ reduction efficiency.
- **Interactive exploration**: planned Streamlit dashboard (modular scaffold included).

The software is intended for researchers in **inorganic/organic hybrid materials, photocatalysis, and energy materials**, providing a **reproducible workflow** for screening POM/MOF-based photocatalysts.

- Easy-to-modify Python scaffold for adding:
  - DFT/DFTB descriptors
  - GNN (CGCNN/ALIGNN) structural learning models
- Example dataset included for demonstration
- GitHub Actions CI ensures reproducibility and code integrity
